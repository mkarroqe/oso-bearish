# Beyond RBAC: Scaling Authorization as Your B2B SaaS Grows

Your SaaS started simple. Basic users, premium users, admins. Clean, easy roles. Then you hit product-market fit, scaled your team, and suddenly authorization became your architectural nightmare.

Sound familiar? Here's how we solved team-based authorization at scale using ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control) with Oso.

## The Growing Pains: When RBAC Breaks Down

Let's say you're building a financial analytics platform. You start with:

```typescript
// Simple RBAC - worked great at first
if (user.role === 'analyst') {
  return canEditRecommendations();
}
```

Then business reality hits:
- Tech analysts should only edit tech stock recommendations
- Finance analysts only handle financial sector stocks  
- Some analysts are "super" analysts who can edit everything

Suddenly your authorization code looks like:

```typescript
// Authorization logic spreading everywhere ðŸ˜±
if (user.role === 'analyst' && 
    user.analyst_type === 'regular' && 
    user.groups.includes('tech') && 
    stock.industry === 'tech') {
  return true;
}
```

This hardcoded approach doesn't scale. Every new team, every new business rule means touching authorization code across your entire application.

## Enter ReBAC: Relationships, Not Just Roles

ReBAC shifts from asking "What role does this user have?" to "What relationships does this user have with this resource?"

Here's how we modeled team-based stock authorization with Oso:

```polar
# Policy-driven authorization that scales
analyst_can_modify_stock(user: User, stock_symbol: String) if
    group_id in user.groups and
    group_covers_stock(group_id, stock_symbol);

# Define which groups cover which stocks
group_covers_stock("tech", "NVDA");
group_covers_stock("tech", "AAPL");
group_covers_stock("finance", "JPM");
```

The magic? Business logic lives in policy, not scattered across your codebase.

## TypeScript + Oso: Type-Safe Authorization

Senior developers love this part. Your authorization becomes as type-safe as the rest of your TypeScript application:

```typescript
export async function canModifyStock(
  user: User, 
  stock: Stock
): Promise<boolean> {
  const oso = getOso();
  const osoUser = new OsoUser(user);
  const osoStock = new OsoStock(stock);
  return oso.isAllowed(osoUser, 'modify', osoStock);
}
```

IDE autocompletion, compile-time safety, and refactoring support for security-critical code.

## The Demo: Stock Recommendations Platform

I built a [Next.js demo](https://github.com/your-repo) that showcases this pattern:

- **Al Gorithm** (tech analyst) can edit NVIDIA and Apple recommendations
- **Finn Tek** (finance analyst) can edit JPMorgan recommendations  
- **Ana Lyst** (super analyst) can edit everything
- **Addie Min** (admin) has full access

The key insight: authorization logic is centralized in Polar policies, not scattered through React components or API routes.

## Performance at Scale: Bulk Authorization

Growing SaaS means more users, more data, more permission checks. We solved the N+1 authorization problem with bulk APIs:

```typescript
// Before: 8 stocks = 8 API calls ðŸ˜°
stocks.map(stock => canModify(user, stock))

// After: 8 stocks = 1 API call ðŸš€
await canModifyStocksBulk(user, stocks)
```

## Why CTOs Care

- **Audit trails**: Every permission decision is traceable
- **Compliance**: Centralized policies make SOX/SOC2 easier
- **Developer velocity**: New features don't require authorization rewrites
- **Security**: Policy-driven is harder to get wrong than scattered conditionals

## The Bottom Line

ReBAC isn't just a patternâ€”it's how authorization grows with your business. When your next business requirement is "users can only access resources their team owns," you'll be ready.

Your authorization system should scale as elegantly as your product. With Oso and ReBAC, it can.
